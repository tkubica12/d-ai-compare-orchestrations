# Implementation Log

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview (2025-07-31)

### Core Architectural Decisions
- **MCP Protocol Adoption**: Replaced traditional REST APIs with Model Context Protocol for AI-native tool exposure and better orchestration integration
- **Three-Tier Autonomy Comparison**: Established comparison framework across Fixed (LangGraph), Dynamic Planning (Semantic Kernel), and Self-Orchestrated (AI Foundry Agent Service) approaches
- **Container-First Strategy**: Independent MCP server deployment to Azure Container Apps with separate pyproject.toml for clean CI/CD

### Technical Stack & Standards
- **Package Management**: uv with pyproject.toml for modern Python dependency management
- **Data Models**: Pydantic v2 for validation and camelCase â†” snake_case conversion
- **Testing**: pytest with comprehensive async support and business scenario coverage
- **Containerization**: Multi-stage Docker builds optimized for production deployment

### Business Process & Success Metrics
- **Core Workflow**: User request â†’ Policy validation â†’ Product search â†’ Supplier analysis â†’ Strategy application â†’ Order recommendation
- **Change Case Focus**: Complex purchase strategies and conditional auditing to test orchestration adaptability
- **Success Metrics**: Token usage measurement, development effort quantification, adaptation cost analysis

## ðŸš€ MCP Server Implementation - Completed

### Framework & Architecture
**FastMCP v2 Integration**: Production-ready MCP server with 7 business tools covering complete purchase workflow
- **Tool Coverage**: User lookup, department policies, budget tracking, product search, supplier comparison, audit logging
- **Smart Search**: Equivalent term matching ("computer" â†’ "Business Laptop") with deduplication
- **Data Layer**: Single `DataStore` class with JSON loading and camelCase conversion

### Code Quality & Structure
**Clean Implementation**: Eliminated duplications and established clear separation of concerns
- **Removed**: `data_manager.py` (redundant), problematic `__init__.py` files causing import conflicts
- **Consolidated**: Single `data_store.py` as source of truth for business data access
- **Fixed**: Import paths, JSON field mapping, test data ID consistency

### Production Readiness
**Deployment Configuration**: Full Azure Container Apps preparation
- **Docker**: Multi-stage builds with security (non-root user), health checks, size optimization
- **Testing**: 7/7 tests passing with comprehensive business scenario coverage
- **HTTP Transport**: Network-accessible MCP server (not stdio mode) with environment-based port configuration

## ðŸŽª Business Data & Scenarios - Validated

### Mock Data Ecosystem
- **Users**: alice-001 (IT), bob-002 (HR), carol-003 (Marketing) with realistic department associations
- **Products**: 5 products with full supplier matrix, pricing, and delivery data
- **Departments**: IT (generous budget, electronics), HR (tight budget, office supplies), Marketing (mixed permissions)

### Test Scenarios Verified
- âœ… Budget constraint validation and spending calculations
- âœ… Policy violation detection and enforcement
- âœ… Supplier comparison with 5+ options per product
- âœ… Equivalent product matching with intelligent search
- âœ… Cross-department permission and strategy differences
- âœ… Audit trail creation and compliance logging

## ðŸ”„ Next Phase: Orchestration Implementation

### Ready for Integration
MCP server is production-ready for consumption by three orchestration approaches:
1. **LangGraph**: Static workflow implementation
2. **Semantic Kernel**: Dynamic planning approach  
3. **AI Foundry Agent Service**: Self-orchestrated solution

### Development Strategy
- Create separate orchestration project with independent pyproject.toml
- Implement token usage measurement framework across all approaches
- Test adaptability with change cases (complex strategies, conditional auditing)
- Quantify development effort and adaptation costs

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# MCP Server Operations
uv sync                                    # Install dependencies
uv run python main.py                     # Start server
uv run pytest tests/ -v                   # Run test suite
docker build -t purchase-order-mcp .      # Build container
```

## ï¿½ Key Implementation Insights

### Technical Lessons Learned
- **Simplicity Over Complexity**: Script-based approach works better than complex package structures for MCP servers
- **Import Path Management**: Relative imports and careful `__init__.py` usage prevent conflicts
- **HTTP vs Stdio**: Network accessibility crucial for containerized deployments
- **Data Consistency**: Exact JSON field matching essential for test reliability

### Design Principles Maintained
- **Container-First**: Every component designed for independent deployment
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Business scenarios drive test coverage
- **Clean Separation**: MCP server remains independent of orchestration logic
- **Production Quality**: Security, health checks, and optimization from day one
