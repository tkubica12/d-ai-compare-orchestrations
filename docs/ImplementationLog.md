# Implementation Log

## Project Initialization (Phase 0)

### Date: 2025-07-31

#### Architectural Decisions Made
1. **MCP Protocol Over Traditional APIs**: Chose Model Context Protocol for business data access instead of REST APIs to better integrate with AI orchestration systems
2. **Three-Tier Autonomy Comparison**: Defined clear levels - Fixed (LangGraph), Dynamic Planning (Semantic Kernel), Self-Orchestrated (AI Foundry Agent Service)
3. **Change Case Focus**: Identified two key business changes to test adaptability:
   - Complex purchase strategies requiring calculations
   - Conditional auditing based on department policies

#### Technical Stack Confirmed
- **Package Management**: uv with pyproject.toml for modern Python dependency management
- **Data Models**: Pydantic for validation and serialization
- **Testing**: pytest with async support for comprehensive testing
- **Protocol**: MCP for AI-native tool exposure

#### Business Process Defined
Core workflow: User request → User lookup → Policy validation → Product search → Supplier analysis → Strategy application → Order recommendation

#### Success Metrics Established
- Token usage measurement across approaches
- Development effort quantification
- Adaptation cost analysis for change cases
- Business accuracy validation

#### Next Steps
1. Implement MCP server with business data tools
2. Create comprehensive mock data with realistic business scenarios
3. Build three orchestration approaches
4. Develop testing framework for comparison
5. Implement change cases for adaptability analysis

#### Key Design Principles
- Simplicity and readability in implementation
- Comprehensive documentation of decisions and trade-offs
- Measurable comparison criteria
- Real-world business scenario simulation
