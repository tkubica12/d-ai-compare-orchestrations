## üìã Executive Summary

**Final Recommendation:**
Here‚Äôs a summary of your request and the analysis:

1. User: Bob Smith (HR department)
2. Request: Most expensive ergonomic office chair

Step-by-step review:
- The department policy for HR allows purchases in the "office-supplies" category, which includes ergonomic office chairs.
- However, the HR department must use a "cheapest" purchase strategy. This means only the lowest-priced products in the allowed category can be approved, not the most expensive.

Product options found:
- The most expensive ergonomic office chair available is $449.99 from Premium Tech Solutions.
- The cheapest available is $249.99.

Decision:
- According to department policy, you cannot purchase the most expensive chair. The policy requires you to select the lowest-priced chair available ($249.99).

Recommendation:
- If you want to proceed with the purchase, I recommend the $249.99 ergonomic office chair to comply with policy and budget rules.
- If you need additional justification for a more expensive option (e.g., a special ergonomic need), you may need management or policy exemption approval.

Let me know how you‚Äôd like to proceed!
